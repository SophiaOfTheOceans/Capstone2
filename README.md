# Capstone Project 2: Weekly Sales Forecasting of Walmart Stores
 
Walmart is a global supermarket chain, and it has an annual revenue of 500 billion dollars, making it one of the largest retailers in the world. In this capstone project, I forecasted the weekly revenue of different Walmart store-department combinations using a random forest model, as well as others, trained with past information about past sales and other factors such as the local fuel price and unemployment rate of the store. 

In the "notebooks" folder, you can find the code and further explanation of the process. The "EDA and Data Wrangling" shows the filling in of some missing values as well as exploration of trends in the data using a graphical method. The "Inferential Statistics" explores the patterns discovered during the exploratory data analysis using a more formal statistical approach. The "Feature Selection and Engineering" details the creation and deletion of features to give better results. The "Machine Learning" contains information on further preprocessing and how the different models were created, in addition to how well they performed relative to each other. The lowest mean absolute error was 1566.00 dollars.

In the "Reports" folder, there is one project proposal, two intermediate reports, a final report, and a presentation of the work here.
